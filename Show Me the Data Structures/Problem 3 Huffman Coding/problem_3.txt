Problem 3: Huffman Coding

Design Implementation:
Here, I first took a text and encoded it using huffman encoding and then decoded it back to the original text.

Time Complexity:
O(nlogn) for using sorted() method and O(n) for iterating a for-loop in huffman encoding.
So, O(nlogn) for huffman encoding.

O(n) for iterating two for-loops in huffman decoding.

Hence, total time complexity is O(nlogn).

Space Complexity:
O(n) for storing the list.
