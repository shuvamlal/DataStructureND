Problem 4: Active Directory

Design Implementation:
Here, I have implemented wheather some users is present in groups or not which is done 
by implementing class.

Time Complexity:
O(n) for iterating over a for-loop and O(m) for using recursion.
Hence, Total Time Complexity is O(m x n).

Space Complexity:
O(m x n) for storing stacks.
