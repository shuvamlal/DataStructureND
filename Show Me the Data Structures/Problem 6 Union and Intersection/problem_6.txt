Problem 6: Union and Intersection

Design Implementation:
Here, two LinkedList are created such that we have to find wheather their union and intersections exists or not.
For unions we just removed the duplicates and for intersections, only took the common elements presents in both the lists.

Time Complexity:
O(m+n) for iterating over the loop of two different lists.

Space Complexity:
O(n) for storing list.
