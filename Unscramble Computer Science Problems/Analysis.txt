Task0: 
This has time complexity of O(1).
As in this task it permforms two operations. That's why it has worst Time Complexity of O(1).

Task1: 
This has time complexity of O(n).
In this task, we iterate over a for-loop twice each for calls and texts, 
which gives worst Time Complexity O(n).

Task2: 
This has time complexity of O(n).
In this task, we iterate over a for-loop for calls which has worst Time Complexity of O(n).
Also, we iterate for-loop one more time, which also has worst Time Complexity of O(n).
Hence, Task2 has worst Time Complexity of O(n).

Task3 
PartA: 
This has time complexity of O(nlogn).
Since, like above steps, here also we had iterate for-loop 
but at last used sorted() method which has time complexity of nlogn.

PartB: 
This has time complexity of O(n).
Here, we just iterated through a single for-loop which makes it O(n).

Hence, Task3 has worst Time Complexity of O(nlogn).

Task4: 
This has time complexity of O(nlogn).
Since, like above steps, here also we had iterate for-loop 
but at last used sorted() method which has worst time complexity of nlogn.
