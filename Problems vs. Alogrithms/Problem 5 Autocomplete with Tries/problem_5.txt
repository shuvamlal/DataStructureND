Problem 5: Autocomplete with Tries

Design Reasoning:
Here, In TrieNode, their was an inclusion of the suffixes function.
At each recurrent call, a child node is created under root node.

Time Complexity:
O(n) - insert char all over the words
O(n) - iterating over prefixes
O(m x n) - iterating over suffixes loop over children and calls itself m times.

Space Complexity:
O(n) as it holds each node for each letter.
