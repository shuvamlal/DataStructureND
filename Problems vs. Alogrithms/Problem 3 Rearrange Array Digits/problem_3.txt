Problem 3: Rearrange Array Digits

Design Reasoning:
Here, I have used heap sort to first sort the array and then find the two numbers such that their sum is maximum.

Time Complexity:
O(nlogn) as because sorted() method is used for sorting the array first and under for-loop traversal, number are found.

Space Complexity:
O(1) for storing extra constant.
