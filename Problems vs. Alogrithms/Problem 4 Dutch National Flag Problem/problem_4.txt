Problem 4: Dutch National Flag Problem

Design Reasoning:
Here, My approach was to sort the array in binary search like method.
As, first I'm working for all the 0's and pushing them towards the begining of the elements. Then, working on rest of elements.

Time Complexity:
O(n) as because a single while-loop is used for performing the sort.

Space Complexity:
O(1) as we're working on the same array.
