Problem 7: Request Routing in a Web Server with a Trie

Design Reasoning:
Here, the Route was similar to the task as working on Trie, expect that we're also working on the handler.
Where the bonus tasks were to implement the trailing slashes and handler not found.

Time Complexity:
O(n) as because RouteTrie.insert and RouteTrie.find had to iterate over once.

Space Complexity:
O(n) as it holds numbers of different paths.
