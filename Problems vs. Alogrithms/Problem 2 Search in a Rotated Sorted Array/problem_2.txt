Problem 2: Search in a Rotated Sorted Array

Design Reasoning:
For performing this problem, we are using binary search approach.
First finding the pivot using binary search and then finding the target value.

Time Complexity:
O(logn) because we first find a pivot value in O(logn) and then used binary search for finding the target value.

Space Complexity:
O(1) beacuse we are storing values in variables.
