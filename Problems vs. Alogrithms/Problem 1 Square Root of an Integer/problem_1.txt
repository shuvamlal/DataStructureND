Problem 1: Square Root of an Integer

Design Reasoning:
Here, we used binary search and checked wheather the square of mid element is equal to or less than number.
If not, then update the start and end variables accordingly.

Time Complexity:
O(logn) as because it is done under one step.

Space Complexity:
O(1) as it storing a single value.
