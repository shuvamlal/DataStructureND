Problem 6: Unsorted Integer Array

Design Reasoning:
Here, My approach was to approach the problem like initializing the min with some maximum value and max with value 0.
And then traverse them in a loop and then find min and max values.

Time Complexity:
O(n) as because a single while-loop is used for performing the task.

Space Complexity:
O(1) as we're working on the same array.
